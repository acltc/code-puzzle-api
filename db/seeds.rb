Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.\r\nIn addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to jail.\r\nAt the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile.

That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we are interested in. We shall make no distinction between \"Just Visiting\" and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the rule about requiring a double to \"get out of jail\", assuming that they pay to get out on their next turn.\r\nBy starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond with sets of squares.\r\nStatistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO (3.09%) = Square 00.

However, it is normal to play a \"doubles out\" system, which means that the player must land a double (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one or lower means the score for that set of three darts is \"bust\".\r\nWhen a player is able to finish  on their current score it is called a \"checkout\" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s and double bull).\r\nThere are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD3\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nD1\r\nD2\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nS2\r\nD2\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nD2\r\nD1\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nS4\r\nD1\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nS1\r\nS1\r\nD2\r\n\r\n\r\nS1\r\nT1\r\nD1\r\n\r\n\r\nS1\r\nS3\r\nD1\r\n\r\n\r\nD1\r\nD1\r\nD1\r\n\r\n\r\nD1\r\nS2\r\nD1\r\n\r\n\r\nS2\r\nS2\r\nD1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that D1 D2 is considered different to D2 D1 as they finish on different doubles.

  {name: "Digital root clocks", instructions: "Sam and Max are asked to transform two digital clocks into two \"digital root\" clocks.\r\nA digital root clock is a digital clock that calculates digital roots step by step.\r\n\r\nWhen a clock is fed a number, it will show it and then it will start the calculation, showing all the intermediate values until it gets to the result.\r\nFor example, if the clock is fed the number 137, it will show: \"137\"  \"11\"  \"2\" and then it will go black, waiting for the next number.\r\n\r\nEvery digital number consists of some light segments: three horizontal (top, middle, bottom) and four vertical (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).\r\nNumber \"1\" is made of vertical top-right and bottom-right, number \"4\" is made by middle horizontal and vertical top-left, top-right and bottom-right. Number \"8\" lights them all.\r\n\r\nThe clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off.\r\nTo turn on a \"2\" will cost 5 transitions, while a \"7\" will cost only 4 transitions.\r\n\r\nSam and Max built two different clocks.\r\n\r\nSam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows \"137\", then the panel is turned off, then the next number (\"11\") is turned on, then the panel is turned off again and finally the last number (\"2\") is turned on and, after some time, off.\r\nFor the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires:\r\n\r\n\"137\"\r\n:\r\n(2 + 5 + 4)  2 = 22 transitions (\"137\" on/off).\r\n\r\n\"11\"\r\n:\r\n(2 + 2)  2 = 8 transitions (\"11\" on/off).\r\n\r\n\"2\"\r\n:\r\n(5)  2 = 10 transitions (\"2\" on/off).\r\n\r\nFor a grand total of 40 transitions.\r\n\r\nMax's clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it is smart enough to turn off only those segments that won't be needed for the next number.\r\nFor number 137, Max's clock requires:\r\n\r\n\"137\"\r\n:\r\n2 + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions (\"137\" on)\r\n7 transitions (to turn off the segments that are not needed for number \"11\").\r\n\r\n\"11\"\r\n:\r\n0 transitions (number \"11\" is already turned on correctly)\r\n3 transitions (to turn off the first \"1\" and the bottom part of the second \"1\"; \r\nthe top part is common with number \"2\").\r\n\r\n\"2\"\r\n:\r\n4 tansitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a \"2\")\r\n5 transitions (to turn off number \"2\").\r\n\r\nFor a grand total of 30 transitions.\r\n\r\nOf course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one.\r\nThe two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between A = 107 and B = 2107. \r\nFind the difference between the total number of transitions needed by Sam's clock and that needed by Max's one.", solution: "13625242"},

Then,\r\n\r\nIf the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to be virus-free.\r\nIf the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02, the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:\r\n\r\nNegative (and no more tests needed) with probability 0.985 = 0.9039207968.\r\nPositive (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968 = 0.0960792032.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032  5 = 1.480396016.\r\nConsequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average of only 1.480396016  5 = 7.40198008 tests, which represents a huge saving of more than 70% !\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples). E.g.:\r\n\r\nWe may start by running a test on a mixture of all the 25 samples. It can be verified that in about 60.35% of the cases this test will be negative, thus no more tests will be needed.

Otherwise, on each turn i, the player rolls a die. After rolling, if i  t the player can either stop the game and receive a prize equal to the value of the current roll, or discard the roll and try again next turn. If i = t, then the roll cannot be discarded and the prize must be accepted. Before the game begins, t is chosen by the player, who must then pay an up-front cost ct for some constant c. For c = 0, t can be chosen to be infinite (with an up-front cost of 0). Let R(d, c) be the expected profit (i.e. net gain) that the player receives from a single game of optimally-played Ramvok, given a fair d-sided die and cost constant c. For example, R(4, 0.2) = 2.65.

If the face is already blank, then it is changed back to its original value. After the alteration is made, another game of Ramvok can begin (and during such a game, at each turn, the die is rolled until a face with a value on it appears).
